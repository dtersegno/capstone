	\begin{block}{pros}
		\begin{itemize}
			\small
			\item create different NNs to act as players. Perhaps one that can beat a human.
			\item classify players by type (unsupervised)
			\item quantitatively compare decks and strategies
			\item Make as much of my own data as I need by running and saving games on PC
			\item cards are already divided into players
			\item Slack and Twitter have reliable APIs to search for wordle grids
			\item cards and games statistics are easy to encode as arrays of integers.
			\item save many models as different players
			\item sounds like a lot of fun. I'm doing this eventually
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	\begin{alertblock}{cons}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item 			\scriptsize{multiple NNs need to be run and trained on a very large data set before they start making good decisions}
		\item Implementing the game itself and a way for the models to interact with it will take some work.
		\item Entirely abstract. Doesn't show off NLP, regression unit interpretation
		\item regression methods limited

\begin{itemize}
	\item Analyze a deckbuilding video/card game with beta data on thousands of players
	\item Game is entirely discrete --- cards are placed in one of four positions, have easily enumerable, integer qualities.
	\item Quantitatively compare decks and strategies by success
	\item Build a model that can make informed decisions.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Longshot: Inscryption analytics}
	\begin{block}{pros}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Use NNs, decision trees, or other to make player decisions
			\item identify pre-determined card types (wolf, insect, hooved, bird) as supervised learning
			\item identify player types as unsupervised
			\item Game is already divided into discrete steps and cards
			\item Data is already "useful" as it influenced the development
			\item sounds like a lot of fun
			\item active community

\begin{alertblock}{cons}
	\begin{itemize}
		\scriptsize
		\item Waiting to hear back from the developer and publisher. Good chance I wont hear from them.

		\begin{itemize}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item probably not "big data" ---  a statistically small number of scientifically active countries generating statistically small numbers of papers
			\item predictive and classification power may be limited
